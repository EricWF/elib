1.4 filesystem header summary
  -- most functions of the form is_XXX_file(const path& p)
      have a extra trailing comma (ie is_XXX_file(const path& p, ) )
  

1.6 class path
    - in path summary "int compare(const string& str) const" -> 
                      "int compare(const string_type& str) const"
                 
1.12 class file_status
  -- in summary the explicit construct takes a default arguement of
      perms prms = perms_not_knows -- this should be changed to
      perms prms = perms::unknown
                 
1.13 class directory_entry
  -- in class summary operator< is declared twice. (I understand why,  but its
      not needed)
      
  -- all references to filesystem::path should be written as such to
      avoid collision with directory_entry::path
                
system_complete description
  -- in the example it reference complete(path,  current_path())
      should be reference to absolute
                      
last_write_time description
  -- static_cast<std::chrono::time_point>(-1) is not valid
